Damage Log is a FoundryVTT module that monitors for changes to characters' health, and displays those changes in a separate chatlog tab.  Changes can be easily be undone, or re-applied using the chat card's right-click menu.

## Features
* Creates a separate "Damage Log" chat tab.  Whenever an actor takes damage or receives healing, a message containing the HP changes is added to the tab.
* The extra tab can be disabled, in which case the messages go to the normal chatlog.
* Damage can easily be reverted or re-applied using the message's right click menu.
* By default, only the GM can see the damage log.  The GM can optionally let players see the damage log for actors they are permissioned for (the minimum permission level is configurable, and defaults to "owner").
* The GM can also let players see limited damage info for all actors (i.e. the amount of damage taken, but not the old and new HP values).
* Works with [Ready Set Roll](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ready-set-roll-5e/), [Midi QoL](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/midi-qol/), and probably works with other dice rolling modules too.

* Damage Log used to be compatible with the [Tabbed Chatlog](https://github.com/cswendrowski/FoundryVTT-Tabbed-Chatlog) and [Customizable Chat Tabs](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/chat-tabs) modules.  As these modules are no longer compatible with the latest version of Foundry, compatibility with them has been removed.
